          <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
          <p>For now, it's just me, Muhaimin Jobayer. I spend my days crafting websites. When I started college I originally had the idea of going into animation. However, I took a fancy to web development when one of my friends showed me how he built his own website for his business.  After building my first website, and getting instant gratification of praise from others, I was hooked. The internet was my outlet. A new way to show and share my passions. Now, I’m constantly learning web technologies and other design related topics. I do the work I do because I love it. I like the industry. I love to collaborate with other developers. I believe collaborating with others who bring different skill sets and backgrounds to the table, gives me the opportunity to learn from their experience. I like to make the web a better place. Hopefully we cross paths in the real world someday and we can make it a better place together.</p>
          <p>Outside of web development, I love travelling. I try to take a trip every season with my close ones. My last trip was in Houston, TX.</p>

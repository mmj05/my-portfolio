            <h3>About Muhaimin</h3>
            <p>I took a fancy to web development when one of my friends showed me how he built his own website for his business. I immidiately liked the idea of being able to have the skills to create a website on my own. I started learning from free online resources, and found out I have a huge passion for web development. I asked myself, "Why not turn your passion into a career?</p>
            <p>As a Thinkful student I've started my journey to becoming a web developer and I couldn't be more excited. If you are looking to hire a new developer please reach out! My best assets are my creativity, my feeling with technology and my passion.</p>
